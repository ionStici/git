# Maintaining a GitHub Repository

_Explore the features GitHub offers for efficient repository management._

## Initial Setup

_Create your Repository_

- **Name :** Choose a meaningful name reflecting the repository's purpose.
- **About :** Write a concise description and specify related "Topics".
- **Link :** Indicate a website link if applicable.

## Common Files

- **`.gitignore` :** Ignore unnecessary files
- **`README.md` :** Introduce and explain your project
- **`LIECENSE` :** Clarify usage rights
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** & **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** if needed

## Branch Strategy

_Recommendation:_ **Git Flow Branch Strategy**

- `main` for the production-ready code version
- `develop` integration branch for features
- `feature`, `release`, `hotfix` supporting branches

## GitHub Actions

- Set up "GitHub Actions" for continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD) to automate testing and deployment processes.

## Project Management

- **GitHub Projects :** Utilize Kanban-style boards for managing and tracking progress on tasks and issues.
- **Tagging and Releases :** Use git tags to mark stable releases and important project milestones.

## Collaboration

- **Pull Requests :** Ensure all changes are reviewed before merging to the main branch, enhancing code quality.
- **GitHub Issues :** Track and manage enhancements, bugs, suggestions, and other project-related tasks.
- **Labels :** Customize labels for issues and pull requests to organize and prioritize tasks effectively.

## Security

- **Configure Security Features :** Use the "Security" tab to set up Dependabot for dependency updates, and enable security alerts for vulnerabilities.

## GitHub Pages

- **Deployment :** Publish your static website on GitHub Pages.
