# GitHub Projects for Project Management

[About Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects)

**GitHub Projects:** is a feature that helps users organize and prioritize their work. It is based on the Kanban methodology, using cards and boards to visualize workflow stages.

**Key Features:**

- **Boards:** Projects are visualized on boards where cards (representing issues, pull requests, or notes) can be moved across columns (like To Do, In Progress, and Done)
- **Automation:** Automated workflows can move cards between columns when triggered by events (e.g. an issue is closed)
- **Collaboration:** Team members can see updates in real-time, making it easy for everyone to stay in sync.

**How to Use:**

1. Inside a repository, click on the "Projects" tab
2. Create a new project, fill in the name and choose the project template
3. Add cards manually or automatically link issues and pull requests to the project
