# GitHub Issues

[About Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)

**GitHub Issues** are a tool used within GitUb repositories to track all types of work - from bugs and enhancements to questions and general tasks. They function like a to-do list but are integrated with your project's codebase.

**Key Features:**

- **Tracking Bugs and Tasks:** Users can create issues to track anything that needs attention.
- **Labels and Tags:** Issues can be categorized using labels to denote priority, category, or any other classification.
- **Assignees:** Issues can be assigned to specific team memebers, making it clear who is responsible for what task.
- **Milestones:** Groups of issues can be bundled under a milestone to track progress on a collection of related tasks, like those needed for a specific version of your software.

**How to Use:**

1. Go to the "Issues" tab within your repository
2. Create a new issue, fill in a title, a detailed description, assign it, label it, and if applicable, link it to a milestone.

Once the issue is posted and now open, collaborators and other github users can join the discussion and reference this issue in other issues and pull requests.
