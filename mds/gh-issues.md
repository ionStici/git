## The Issues Tag

Built-in GitHub tracking tool for bugs, errors, potential small feature changes for projects living inside a repo. Collaborators of the repo can see what needs to be worked on (open issues) as well as which tasks were resolved (closed issues).

The issues board acts as a forum for all the collaborators of a repo. Users of a project can submit and discuss bugs they've encountered.

### Labels

We use **labels** to organize different types of issues.

e.g. `bug` and `feature` are common labels used to differentiate between errors and new features.

### Creating an issue

Click `New Issue` button from issue tag, then set the title and content of the issue.

Keep the title epecific but to the point. For descriptions, repositories often have their own guidelines.

Once the issue is posted and now open, collaborators and other github users can add to the discussion and reference this issue in other issues and pull requests.
