# Vite

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a modern frontend build tool.

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app
```

- `index.html` is the entry point to your application (located at the project root).
- Vite supports multi-page apps with multiple `.html` entry points, but you should specify every entry in the config file.

## Configurations

`vite.config.js`
