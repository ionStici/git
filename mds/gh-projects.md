## GitHub Project Management

**GitHub Projects** - direct integration within the repository, letting developers stay within the same ecosystem. We can also create automated project boards and trigger the status of issues and pull requests.

In most cases, projects are linked to repos, which already have existing issues and pull requests, but in other cases, projects can be standalone.

Example of a project with no repo: [GitHub's public roadmap project](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247/views/1)

- Go to "Projects" tag -> click "New Project"

- After filling out the name and description of the new project -> Choose the project template we want to use.

- Once the board is created, [add issues and pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/tracking-work-with-project-boards/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board) to it.
